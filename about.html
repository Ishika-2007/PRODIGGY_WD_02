            <h1> About</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm Ishika Gupta, a dedicated 2nd yaer college student at Banasthali Vidyapith currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree. While I'm still in the early stages of my journey as a frontend developer, I'm filled with enthusiasm and a hunger to learn.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>My interest in technology sparked during my high school years when I started tinkering with basic coding concepts. Since then, I've been captivated by the world of web development, spending hours exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a student, I'm committed to balancing my academic studies with my passion for frontend development. I believe that continuous learning is key to growth, and I'm always eager to dive into new challenges and expand my skill set.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While I may be a beginner in the field, I approach every project with determination and a willingness to push my boundaries. I'm excited to embark on this journey of discovery and development, and I'm eager to see where it takes me.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with friends, exploring new hobbies, and immersing myself in the vibrant culture of college life. I believe in the power of collaboration and community, and I'm looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I'm excited to see where this journey leads and to continue growing as a frontend developer.</p>
